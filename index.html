				<h3>Ornn</h3>
				<div class="images1"></div>
				<h4 class="about-character">About Ornn</h4>
				<p>Ornn is the Freljordian spirit of forging and craftsmanship. He works in the solitude of a massive smithy, hammered out from the lava caverns beneath the volcano Hearth-Home. There he stokes bubbling cauldrons of molten rock to purify ores and fashion items of unsurpassed quality. When other deities—especially Volibear—walk the earth and meddle in mortal affairs, Ornn arises to put these impetuous beings back in their place, either with his trusty hammer or the fiery power of the mountains themselves.</p>
			</div>	

			<!-- Thresh -->
			<div>
				<h3>Thresh</h3>
				<div class="images2"></div>
				<h4 class="about-character">About Thresh</h4>
				<p>Sadistic and cunning, Thresh is an ambitious and restless spirit of the Shadow Isles. Once the custodian of countless arcane secrets, he was undone by a power greater than life or death, and now sustains himself by tormenting and breaking others with slow, excruciating inventiveness. His victims suffer far beyond their brief mortal coil as Thresh wreaks agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his unholy lantern to torture for all eternity.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Sett -->
			<div>
				<h3>Sett</h3>
				<div class="images3"></div>
				<h4 class="about-character">About Sett</h4>
				<p>A leader of Ionia's growing criminal underworld, Sett rose to prominence in the wake of the war with Noxus. Though he began as a humble challenger in the fighting pits of Navori, he quickly gained notoriety for his savage strength, and his ability to take seemingly endless amounts of punishment. Now, having climbed through the ranks of local combatants, Sett has muscled to the top, reigning over the pits he once fought in.</p>
